# Portfolio
 The place that houses all the files I use for my portfolio site! I plan on using just the vanilla stuff on this one, though this will be my introduction to Tailwind.

# Update as of 6/22/25
  The site is now deployed on Vercel, and its fully responsive across all kinds of wacky, cool devices (phones, tablets, laptops, yes, even giant desktop screens). In the future, I might add more onto it, or change around the overall aesthetic. I moved all the Javascript into its own file, since it looked super cluttered in the HTML file. I spent many hours hunched over my screen with my nose buried in Tailwind documentation, but I can say this was a wonderful project to really start off on, and I hope to update it routinely in the future! 
  
  Something I learned in this project was how odd Tailwind's responsive system is. I got a real kick out of finding out that it's a "mobile first" kind of thing when it comes to its breakpoints. But other then that, nothing proved to be too big of a challenge. To be honest, the most frustrating part of this website was when I forgot the meta tag on the About page, which is what caused said responsiveness to not work properly in the first place. Lesson learned there.
